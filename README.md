### Aggregation Operators Package for *R*


> "The process of combining several numerical values into a single 
representative one is called aggregation, and the numerical function 
 performing this process is called aggregation function. 
 This simple definition demonstrates the size of the field of application of aggregation: 
    applied mathematics (e.g. probability, statistics, decision theory), computer science 
    (e.g. artificial  intelligence, operation research), as well as many applied fields 
    (economics and finance, pattern recognition and image processing, data fusion, 
     multicriteria decision making, automated reasoning etc.). Although history of aggregation is probably 
     as old as mathematics (think of the arithmetic mean), its existence
has reminded underground till only recent (...).
