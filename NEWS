0.2-0 /under development/

* The definition of owa(), owmax(), and owmin() is now consistent with
   that of (Grabisch ETAL, 2009), i.e. uses a non-increasingly sorted
   vectors, and not non-decreasingly sorted ones.

* NEW functions: pareto2_test_ad() and exp_test_ad(): (approximate)
   Anderson-Darling goodness-of-fit test for the Pareto-II and
   exponential distribution, respectively.

* *PENDING* NEW disribution implemented: discretized Pareto-Type II
   (floor of Pareto Type-II):
   useful for modeling some phenomenae in social sciences;
   dpareto2_estimate_mle() for MLE estimators;
   XXX() chi-square-based approximate goodness of fit test

* *PENDING* BUGFIX: closure_transitive - resulting matrix
   was not necessarily transitive; the function has been rewritten in C++

* NEW functions: pord_spread() and pord_spreadsym() --
   to compare spread of two equal-length numeric vectors
   (see M. Gagolewski, Dispersion Operators, in preparation, 2013)

* NEW function: d2owa(): a symmetric dispersion operator defined as
   the L2 distance between a numeric vector and an OWA operator

* BUGFIX: prepare_arg_numeric_sorted did not sort some vectors

* all built-in agops now throw an error on empty vectors

* ...TO DO...
