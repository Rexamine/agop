0.2-0 /under development/

* The definition of owa(), owmax(), and owmin() is now consistent with
   that of (Grabisch et al., 2009), i.e. uses nondecreasing
   vectors, and not nonincreasing ones.

* NEW functions: pareto2_test_ad() and exp_test_ad(): (approximate)
   Anderson-Darling goodness-of-fit test for the Pareto-II (with known scale
   parameter) and exponential distribution, respectively.

* *PENDING* NEW disribution implemented: discretized Pareto-Type II
   (floor of Pareto Type-II):
   useful for modeling some phenomena in social sciences;
   see dpareto2_estimate_mle() for MLE estimators;
   and ddpareto2(), pdpareto2(), rdpareto2(), qdpareto2()
   for standard d.f. implementations.

* NEW functions: pord_spread() and pord_spreadsym() --
   to compare spread of two equal-length numeric vectors
   (see Gagolewski M., Dispersion Operators, submitted, 2013).

* NEW function: d2owa(): a symmetric dispersion operator defined as
   the L2 distance between a numeric vector and an OWA operator.

* BUGFIX: rel_closure_transitive() - resulting matrix
   was not necessarily transitive; the function has been rewritten in C++
   and now uses the Warshall algorithm (1962).

* All functions dealing with binary relations now have "rel_" prefix.

* Rewritten to C++: rel_is_reflexive(), rel_is_total(), rel_is_transitive(), 
   rel_closure_total_fair(), .....

* New functions dealing with binary relations:
   rel_closure_reflexive(), ....

* BUGFIX: prepare_arg_numeric_sorted (internal, C++) did not sort some vectors.

* all built-in agops now throw an error on empty vectors.

* ...TO DO...
